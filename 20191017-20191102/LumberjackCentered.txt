               Lumberjack

    I'm a lumberjack and I'm OK    
     I sleep all night and I work all day   
     (He's a lumberjack and he's OK
He sleeps all night and he works all day)

    I cut down trees, I eat my lunch
I go to the lavat'ry                                            
          On Wednesdays I go shopping
    And have buttered scones for tea
           (He cuts down trees...)
         (He's a lumberjack...)

   I cut down trees, I skip and jump
      I love to press wild flow'rs
       I put on women's clothing
        And hang around in bars
        (He cuts down trees...)
         (He's a lumberjack...)
